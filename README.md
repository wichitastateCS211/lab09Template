# `struct`ure
Define an `Album` type using a `struct`. Data members include: artist, title, year, number of tracks, and a
rating (out of 5.0). Declare and implement a function called `printAlbum()`. In `main()`, declare an `Album`,
fill it out, and send it to be printed. No input will be taken from the user.

## Hints
- This time, do hard-code the Album info.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_lab09.cpp
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
